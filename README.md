# Login Firebase
**Login Firebase** is a modern frontend web application built using **React, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase Authentication**. It allows users to securely log in using their credentials, with a smooth and responsive user interface powered entirely on the client side.

# Features
- **Firebase Authentication** – Secure login using Firebase Auth
- **Client-Side Only** – Fully handled on the frontend without a backend server
- **Form Validation** – Prevents empty or invalid input before submission
- **Responsive Design** – Works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Clean and Minimal UI** – Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern look
- **Fast and Lightweight** – Optimized for performance with React

# Technologies Used
- **React** – for building interactive and dynamic components
- **Tailwind CSS** – for fast, responsive, and modern styling
- **Firebase** – for authentication and user session management
- **HTML5** – for structure and layout

# How It Works
- User enters their email and password
- React handles validation and sends credentials to Firebase Authentication
- Firebase verifies the user
- On successful login, user is redirected to the protected page
